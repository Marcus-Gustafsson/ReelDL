# ReelDL
Chrome extension to easier download reels and pictures from social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and Instagram).

## Installation
1. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Turn on **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `extension` folder inside this repository (`/workspace/ReelDL/extension`).
5. Confirm the extension is listed and enabled in Chrome.

## Usage
1. Navigate to Facebook or Instagram and open a reel or video you want to download.
2. Right-click directly on the video area.
3. Choose **Download video with ReelDL** from the context menu.
4. If a download starts, Chrome will save the file to your default downloads folder.
5. If no download starts, try right-clicking the video again or ensure the reel/video is actually playing.

> Note: Some reels/videos use streaming formats that are harder to download. In those cases, the extension may not be able to fetch a direct file URL yet.
